In _Dust Bunny_, you play as a sentient clump of dust navigating a messy bedroom. Your goal is to uncover the fragmented memories of a girl who abandoned her dreams of being an artist to pursue a 'safer' career in Computer Science. The game takes place across five chronological zones that trace her life’s journey from childhood passion to adult pressure.
